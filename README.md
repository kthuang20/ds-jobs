# Analyzing Data Science Careers in 2023

## Motivation
I wanted to create an interactive dashboard for students like me who are also interested in understanding more about the employment and salary of a career in the data science field. This dashboard could help them make an informative decision if the career suits their ideal lifestyle.

As someone who wants to become a data scientist, I was curious about the following:
1. What is the average and median salary of data scientists?
2. Where are data scientists often employed?
3. How common is it for data scientists to work remotely?
4. How prevalant is contract work as a data scientist?
5. What percentage of data scientists are employed at large, medium, and small companies? Is there a perference for data scientists to work at larger companies?

Therefore, I decided to develop a dashboard that could answer this question for not just data scientists, but for other careers in the data science field.


## Dashboard Overview
This dashboard is viewable at: [https://ds-jobs.streamlit.app](https://ds-jobs.streamlit.app).
The sidebar of the dashboard allows the user to select or type in a data science related career of their interest. The main page will then provide visualizations summarizing the following:
* the salary of that job in 2023
* the number of employees employed in various company locations
* the size of the companies that employees worked at
* the employment type (full time, part time, contract workers)
* the flexibility of the work (onsite, hybrid, fully remote)

## Dataset
To dataset used to generate the visualizations was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023).
